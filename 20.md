In this project, we will learn about docker images and containers. 
I used codespaces in github, which has docker engine installed by default in the environment.
Verified that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image
![0  Sudo docker run hello-world](https://github.com/opeyemiagbadero/20.-MIgration-to-the-Cloud-with-Containerization.-Part-1-Docker-DOcker-compose/assets/79456052/200d8fe6-685d-4ae9-ad28-56627c26bfae)

Used a tooling web application which is a PHP-based web solution backed by a MySQL database.

Mysql in container

Step 1: Pull MySQL Docker Image from Docker Hub Registry.

Start by pulling the appropriate Docker image for MySQL. You can download a specific version or opt for the latest release, as seen in the following command: `docker pull mysql/mysql-server:latest`

![1 Pull MYSQL Docker image from Docker Hub Registry](https://github.com/opeyemiagbadero/20.-MIgration-to-the-Cloud-with-Containerization.-Part-1-Docker-DOcker-compose/assets/79456052/9ddeb355-30bb-4b09-b6c4-86197b598d98)

List the images to check that you have downloaded them successfully

![2  docker image ls](https://github.com/opeyemiagbadero/20.-MIgration-to-the-Cloud-with-Containerization.-Part-1-Docker-DOcker-compose/assets/79456052/7349a7a9-4a5d-45cf-87b6-4d603f0d4d13)

Step 2: Deploy the MySQL Container to your Docker Engine
Once you have the image, move on to deploying a new MySQL container with: `docker run --name <container_name> -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<my-secret-pw> -d mysql/mysql-server:latest`
- Replace <container_name> with the name of your choice. If you do not provide a name, Docker will generate a random one
- The -d option instructs Docker to run the container as a service in the background
- Replace <my-secret-pw> with your chosen password
- In the command above, we used the latest version tag. This tag may differ according to the image you downloaded
  
Check to see if the MySQL container is running: Assuming the container name specified is mysql-server by running the command `docker ps`

![3 Step 2: Deploy the MySQL Container to your Docker Engine ](https://github.com/opeyemiagbadero/20.-MIgration-to-the-Cloud-with-Containerization.-Part-1-Docker-DOcker-compose/assets/79456052/0a08b2b0-834e-408b-932e-b2601a1df905)
  
You should see the newly created container listed in the output. It includes container details, one being the status of this virtual environment. The status changes from health: starting to healthy, once the setup is complete
  
Step 3: Step 3: Connecting to the MySQL Docker Container

We can either connect directly to the container running the MySQL server or use a second container as a MySQL client. In this project I used a second container as a MySQL client.

First, create a network: `docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/24 tooling_app_network`

Creating a custom network is not necessary because even if we do not create a network, Docker will use the default network for all the containers you run. By default, the network we created above is of DRIVER Bridge. So, also, it is the default network. You can verify this by running the docker network ls command.
  
![6  pull the image and run the container, all in one command like below, create a file called create_usersql and add the codes as found in Dares documentation and ](https://github.com/opeyemiagbadero/20.-MIgration-to-the-Cloud-with-Containerization.-Part-1-Docker-DOcker-compose/assets/79456052/c15f61c0-9c06-4603-a75e-aae3226f124f)
  
But there are use cases where this is necessary. For example, if there is a requirement to control the cidr range of the containers running the entire application stack. This will be an ideal situation to create a network and specify the --subnet
  
Run the MySQL Server container using the created network.
  
First, let us create an environment variable to store the root password: ` $ export MYSQL_PW= `

Then, pull the image and run the container, all in one command like below: `docker run --network tooling_app_network -h mysqlserverhost --name=mysql-server -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$MYSQL_PW  -d mysql/mysql-server:latest`
  
Flags used
- -d runs the container in detached mode
- --network connects a container to a network
- -h specifies a hostname
